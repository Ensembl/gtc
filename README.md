# Genome Targeting Catalogue
The Genome Targeting Catalogue (GTC) is a public repository of experiments using CRISPR/Cas enzymes, manually curated from published literature. 

The GTC application uses the [material-table](https://material-table.com/) React component for searching, filtering and browsing data.
A simple webserver is included using [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/).

## Build the GTC
The GTC requires npm and Rust nightly.

> npm install
>
> npm run-script build
>
> cargo build --release
